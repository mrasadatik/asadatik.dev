# **Security Policy**

## **Introduction**

At **Asadatik.dev**, the security of my portfolio repository is a top priority. This document outlines the security practices for the repository and provides clear guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities. Maintaining a secure environment ensures the integrity of my work and helps foster trust within the community exploring the projects.

## **1. Reporting Vulnerabilities**

If you discover a security vulnerability within the **asadatik.dev** repository, I encourage you to report it promptly. While the repository is public, I have clear guidelines for handling vulnerability reports to ensure the security and privacy of my work.

### **1.1 Reporting an Issue**

You are welcome to report security vulnerabilities publicly by creating an issue in the repository's issue tracker. Please use the **security issue template** provided to ensure that all necessary details are included when reporting a security vulnerability.

### **1.2 Response Timeline**

I will review all reported issues as promptly as possible. My commitment is to acknowledge the report within **48 hours**. After that, I will provide updates on remediation efforts and any timelines for fixing the vulnerability.

## **2. Security Best Practices**

To ensure the security of the **asadatik.dev** repository, I follow a set of best practices in managing dependencies, commits, and code contributions. Below are some of the key practices I follow:

### **2.1 Dependency Management**

Before adding or updating dependencies in the repository, I follow these steps to ensure security:

- **Version Check**: Ensure the dependency version is compatible with the projects in the repository.
- **Vulnerability Check**: Assess the dependency for known vulnerabilities using trusted security databases.
- **Project Activity**: Confirm that the dependency is actively maintained and updated.
- **Quality Assurance**: Evaluate the dependency based on community feedback and performance metrics.

### **2.2 GPG Signing for Commits**

All commits made to the **asadatik.dev** repository are **GPG signed** to ensure authenticity and the integrity of contributions. This practice verifies my identity as the sole contributor and prevents unauthorized changes to the codebase.

### **2.3 Conduct Code Reviews**

Although only I contribute to the repository, I conduct thorough code reviews to ensure that no security vulnerabilities are introduced into the projects. Code reviews are especially critical when implementing new features or making changes to core components.

### **2.4 Follow Secure Coding Guidelines**

I adhere to established secure coding standards and best practices to minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

## **3. Access Control and Monitoring**

Given that the repository is public but only I can contribute to it, itâ€™s important to enforce appropriate access control and monitoring:

### **3.1 Access Control**

The repository is publicly accessible, but **only I**, Md Asaduzzaman Atik, am allowed to contribute to it. Public users can explore, copy, and learn from the content, but they cannot directly modify the repository.

### **3.2 Continuous Monitoring**

I regularly monitor activity within the repository for any unusual or potentially malicious behavior. Although contributions are restricted to me, I keep track of public issues and discussions to address security concerns and potential vulnerabilities raised by others.

## **4. Conclusion**

Thank you for your interest in my portfolio repository **asadatik.dev**. By reporting vulnerabilities and adhering to security best practices, you help maintain a secure environment and ensure the integrity of my work. Your cooperation is essential in fostering a safe and secure space for learning, development, and growth.

Should you notice any vulnerabilities or security-related issues, please feel free to open an issue, and I will address it accordingly.
